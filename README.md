# Study-Material-Detector-Using-AI
This project uses AI to detect different types of study materials from images.  
It can identify:

- Handwritten notes
- Printed or downloaded PDFs
- Cheat sheets
- Flashcards

The project is built using:
- **HTML, CSS, Tailwind, JavaScript** for frontend
- **Teachable Machine / TensorFlow.js** for image recognition

Simply upload an image, and the AI model will classify it into one of the categories above with confidence scores.

This tool is useful for students to organize their study materials efficiently.
